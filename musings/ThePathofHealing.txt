`title`The Path of Healing
In January 1997 I lost my mother to breast cancer. I was seven months pregant when she passed and as I went down to Cabarita beach a few days later in an attempt to find solice, I asked spirit to explain to me what was happening inside me. I was in deep undescribable turmoil and heavy grief. I was shown a large pane of mirror dropping to the floor and shattering into hundred of pieces, and I remember thinking that it was going to take a long time to get that back together again.

I was broken. I remember reading a random story about a young aboriginal girl who had been violently raped being taken to a healing creek to call her spirit back into her body for it was no longer attached to it as a result of that trauma. I remember resonating to that feeling, that I no longer felt anything, I was completely numb when I used to feel everything with sensitivity.

My baby son helped me remember the unconditional love I shared with my mother, and somehow still thankfully held inside of me. I will always be thankful for his spirit chosing me as his mother under such difficult circumstances. Without him to care for and the gift of becoming a mother, I genuinely believe I would have followed a deeply self-destructive path I may not have survived. With him, I have done my best for us both, and I believe my mother would be proud of the grandson she has today.
